TODO list:

- skybox/dome
- checklines
- fix font
- nicer icons
- path to assets (ask + store in config afterwards)
- first dialog should be new/open
- monkey testing for crashes (for example: click on save button while the new dialog is open, before a map exists)
- hotkeys for actions (both use and their visibility in tooltips)
- move to using the media/assets repo instead of dropbox library
- create some XMLs for media objects
- show the last N edited maps in the first dialog for quick re-editing
- road mesh texture & export
