SuperTuxKart - Track Editor

##---BUILD---

If you are on Windows, using Visual Studio, you have a ready solution with all dependencies in the vs directory.

Otherwise in order to build the editor, you will need Irrlicht and PhysFS as well.
It is recommended to use my Irrlicht branch:
https://github.com/mcsab/irrlicht

##---RUN---

To run the program, download the editor folder, and place it to your stk data folder, so the editor directory is next to the textures and tracks directories.
